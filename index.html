              <h1> FPIs pump ₹13,347 crore in Indian equities, debt flows reduce in April so far: Will inflows continue in FY25? </h1>
              <p>Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have reduced their momentum of buying in Indian equities since the onset of the new fiscal 2024-25 (FY25) after reporting solid inflows in the previous fiscal. FPIs started the year on a strong note and have so far extended the buying streak in Indian markets. However, experts are doubtful if the inflows will continue in near-term due to the India-Mauritius tax treaty.
                FPIs have bought ₹13,347 crore worth of Indian equities and the total inflow stands at ₹15,706 crore as of April 12, taking into account debt, hybrid, debt-VRR, and equities, according to National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL) data. The total debt inflows stand at ₹1,522 crore so far this month.

            Meanwhile, former Australia captain Aaron Finch felt that Dhoni should not let his fans wait and bat earlier for CSK. Speaking on Star Sports, he said, "Yeah, I think everybody's 
            been waiting for MS Dhoni to bat for a little bit longer and get out there early on. But, I mean, it's just unbelievable to watch, I think just seeing the sheer excitement that
             he brings people, when he walks out the bat. People are not sure how long they're going to see it for, so it's unbelievable.

          <p> Chinese tech giant Huawei has started allowing customers to register their interest in an upcoming smartphone model it has yet to describe, stoking anticipation that the latest version of its high-end P series phones is on its way.
            The company jumped back into the premium smartphone market last year with its Mate 60 series, a launch celebrated by state media as a triumph over U.S. sanctions on the firm. The launch has also been blamed for a steep decline in Apple’s iPhone sales in China.
            Speculation has built up in recent months that Huawei will soon launch the P70, which is expected to, like the Mate 60, contain an advanced China-made chip

            <h1> Google up against California's news law, starts blocking news websites </h1>
            <p> Google in a blog post on Friday said that it is beginning a “short-term test for a small percentage of California users” where they will remove links to California news websites. This is in response to the California Journalism Preservation Act (CJPA), which was cleared in the American state’s legislative assembly in 2023.
                In the blog post, Google accused CJPA of being a law that would favour conglomerates and hedge funds at the expense of small local newsrooms.
                “It would favour media conglomerates and hedge funds—who've been lobbying for this bill—and could use funds from CJPA to continue to buy up local California newspapers, strip them of journalists, and create more ghost papers that operate with a skeleton crew to produce only low-cost, and often low-quality, content. CJPA would also put small publishers at a disadvantage and limit consumers’ access to a diverse local media ecosystem,” wrote Jaffer Zaidi, VP, Global News Partnerships, in the blog post.</p>
